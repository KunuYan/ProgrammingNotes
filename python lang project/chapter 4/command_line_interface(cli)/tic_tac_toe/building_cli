Terminal base type of applications:
    - present user with a menu
    - promp user for input based on choice
    -call a function based on the choice, that function call on a logic parts's function
    - output result you got from the function and prompt for next input
    
    !! Basically Kali linux hacking tools are mostly CLI !!

Python has tools that make cli easier to build and to make it more effective
    - cmd module is a module for buiilding cli quickly, must use OOP, check out cli_cmd.py for more info.
    - just like how terminall command can have arguments like --help, -v we can also do it for our python cli program with argparse modul, check out ttc_cli_cmd.py
    - can also add in tkinter.messagebox to display information without going full GUI, check out ttc_tkdialogue_cli.py
