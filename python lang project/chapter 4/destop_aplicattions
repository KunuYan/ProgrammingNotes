 - An applications contains multiples files that each do specifique task
 - the work can be split how ever the programmer wants, but usually for simple applications there are split into 4 parts:
 
            API(s):
                -contains functions and methodes that can query the database to retrieve or insert data so that it can be used without doing tidious things(writing sql every time).
                -C.R.U.D. (create, read, update and delete)
            file(s) that interract with data:
                -contains functions to store and retrieve data that the logic file needs.
                -interacts with the API to do what it needs
            logic(s):
                - files that do all the processing and calculations
                - servers files
                - tell other files what to do, retrieve data from them and process those data
            client(s):
                - Part of the appliction that interacts with user
                - output and input data to and from the user
                - call on functions from the logic part in order to do something with the input
                - output and prompt user based on the result it got from calling the logic functions
                - can be a command line interface(CLI) or GUI
